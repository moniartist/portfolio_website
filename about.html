    				<p>Welcome to the personal portfolio page of graphic designer, front-end web developer, illustrator and fine artist, Monica Gibbs.</p>
    				<p>A brief background on me. I’ve been creating art in some capacity my entire life. I guess one could say that art chose me from the beginning. I love clean and what I call “focused” design that has a strong conceptual base. This means before I begin a project, I love to think about how I will visually communicate the story behind it, prepare its functionality and how the audience will interact with the final product.</p>
    				<p>I’ve used this approach in everything from logo design to direct mail pieces; from brochures to corporate branding; and from poster design to website design and beyond.</p>
    				<p>Take a quick look at just a few of my design projects in my portfolio area. Thanks for visiting!</p>
    				<p>Specialties: corporate identity and branding, logo design, promotional design (posters, flyers, direct mail, etc.), editorial design, layout, web design, HTML, CSS, UI/UX, WordPress, illustration, oil painting</p>
